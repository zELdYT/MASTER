## MASTER: The Swiss Army Knife for C

MASTER is an ambitious open-source project developed by a single developer, aiming to provide a wide range of powerful features in the C programming language. From multimedia processing to quantum computing, MASTER aspires to be your go-to tool for tackling diverse challenges.

**What's Already Included:**

* **Multimedia:**
    * Parsing BMP and WAV files.
    * Creating WAV files.
    * Parsing CSV and TSV files.
* **Encoding and Compression:**
    * LZ77, LZ78, and RLE compression algorithms.
    * Functions for Base64, Base32, and Base16 encoding.
* **Mathematics:**
    * A library for working with large integers (bigint).
    * Quaternions, octonions, sedenions, and complex numbers.
    * Series (including Taylor series).
    * Statistical functions (similar to Python's `statistics` module).
* **Random Numbers:**
    * Various random number generators, including the Mersenne Twister.
